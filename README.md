This is my personal portfolio page where I display working and ever growing knowledge of coding in a purposeful way; To display my professional expertise.
My page features several examples of different coding languages including CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript. The page mainly 
is arranged using flexbox style, with a hint of basic width properties to work seamlessly with flexbox for a resposive experience.
Our page includes examples of CSS too from basic class targeting and general purpose property addressing to use of pseudo-classes and gradients.
Also included is use of basic JavaScript. That is used to add and remove both classes and properties from elements on the page to prduce
a funtional hamburger menu. The colors and styles were chosen to reflect my personal profered color pallet.

Features on the page:
•Mobile first with 3 responsive design widths 
•Hover Pseudo-class in the footer navigation
•Flexbox
•Vertical & Horizontal Hamburger Menu that uses JS and CSS together
•Working GitIgnore File
